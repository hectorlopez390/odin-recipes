        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Champurrado</em> is a chocolate-based <em>atole</em>, a warm and thick Mexican beverage, prepared with 
            either masa de maiz (lime-treated corn dough), masa harina (a dried version of this dough), or corn flour (simply
            very finely ground dried corn, especially local varieties grown for <em>atole</em>);<em>piloncillo</em>; water
            or milk; and occasionally containing cinnamon, anise seed or vanilla. Champurrado is traditionally served with
            churros in the morning as a siple breakfast or as a late afternoon snack. Champurrado is also very popular during
            Day of the Dead and at <em>Las Posadas</em> (during the Christmas season), where it is served alongside tamales.
            Champurrado may also be made with alcohol.
